                    Minnie’s Helping Hands is a growing non-profit organization that has limited resources, hindering their capabilities to expand and reach various communities such as the formerly incarcerated or past drug-addicts that need support. With more resources, like brick and mortar or marketing, Minnie’s Helping Hand’s visibility, technology, and partnerships can widely increase.

                    They are currently working to identify a reliable and reputable funding source to grow their organization. With financial support, they could invest more in extending their existing services of clothing and toy drives and implement future services of food banks and housing assistance resources.  This opened an opportunity for our team to help Rosalyn find a source to write a grant proposal and define the funding needs, such as operational and program costs in order to meet the needs of various communities.

                    As it is a very small non-profit, they did not have a existing website, so in order to implement a reliable resource for communities, my team and I wanted to create an informational website where individuals in need and sponsors could reach out to Minnie’s Helping Hands.

                In order to connect with the client, communication was key. With our weekly client meetings with Rosalyn Holmes, the founder of Minnie’s Helping Hands, we were able to pin point the main problems that the website would solve. This additionally helped our team understand what specific services Minnie’s Helping Hands offers, the mission statement and goals,  background information, website media collateral, and future ideas for the organization.

                With all the information collected, our team discovered that the client visioned a very modern and simple website that was highly informational on donation methods and services offered.  Overall, my team and I had an amazing opportunity to connect with a client with a good cause and contribute towards their mission.

            The project vision that we aimed to establish is an online website for Minnie’s Helping Hands that provided a wide array of resources, support, and community services for underprivileged and impoverished communities. Our team’s main goal was to enhance the exposure of the organization and provide a user-friendly experience for users that may not be able to easily access information about the resource. By collaborating with the founder, Rosalyn, we hoped to grow her non-profit organization and help her receive support for funding, business proposals, and a physical space to manage Minnie’s Helping Hands.
        </div> 
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
            We planned to achieve this vision by following a project plan that outlined a schedule of our prototype, wireframe, user testing, and code deadlines. Through weekly team meetings and client meetings with Minnie’s Helping Hands, our team valued communication and consistency in order to implement this website successfully. 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
            In order to create an intuitive and seamless website, we began with several iterations of low, mid, and high fidelity prototypes that led us to create concrete website designs through HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. With three rounds of user testing, we improved the interactivity of the website significantly and present a final platform that Minnie’s Helping Hands could use to expand their organization.

            With the limited resources available to Minnie’s Helping Hands, this hindered their capabilities to expand and reach various communities that need support. With more resources, like brick and mortar, Rosalyn could increase Minnie’s Helping Hand’s marketing for increased visibility, technology for wider outreach, and partnerships for collaboration opportunities. Rosalyn had several goals, such as hosting clothing and toy drives, starting literacy and GED prep programs, and collaborating with home health agencies, and with the correct resources, there would be a high opportunity to complete these goals successfully. 
        </div> 
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
            Another challenge that our team noticed was the lack of awareness and outreach of Minnie’s Helping Hands. This organization had a lot of potential opportunities to work with other non-profits such as the Wilkinsburg Community Development Center to help create employment opportunities, youth programs, and workshops. Furthermore, Minnie’s Helping Hands was only operated by Rosalyn and her three children, so with more awareness and outreach, this website created another opportunity for Minnie’s Helping Hands to receive more volunteer engagement.

    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
            Finally, Minnie’s Helping Hands was working to identify a reliable and reputable funding source to grow their organization. Funding is an essential aspect of Minnie’s Helping Hands that would significantly develop their programs and increase the amount of staff, outreach, and services they currently have. With financial support, they could invest more in extending their existing services of clothing and toy drives and implement future services of food banks and housing assistance resources.  Additionally, the website would open an opportunity for us to help Rosalyn find a source to write a grant proposal and define the funding needs, such as operational and program costs in order to meet the needs of various communities.

            The competitors that we analyzed were other non-profit local organizations in the Pittsburgh area. The Light of Life Rescue Mission and Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh were identified as the main two competitors of Minnie’s Helping Hands.

    <div class="row">

            The <em>Light of Life Rescue Mission</em> is a religious non-profit that aims to meet the needs of homeless people in Pittsburgh by providing them with food and shelter.

    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 mt-3 text start" >
            The <em>Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh </em>is another religious non-profit that has a more general mission statement to “serve our communities’ critical needs with compassion, healing and hope.”

    <div class="row">

    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 mt-3 text start" >
            Both of these organizations have a larger volunteer base and reach than our client. They have a well established religious organization that provides financial and physical support. Their online presence is stronger with well organized websites and social media accounts as seen with the screenshots. The Catholic Charities has a lot of content from their previous events and multiple points of user interactions. The Light of Life website looks more organized with a very prominent color scheme and consistent theme.

    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
            On the other hand, a weakness to consider is that because of their large base, they cannot focus on a specific group and cater and fully commit to their needs. There is a lack of interpersonal relationships, and the organizations cannot pay attention to every detail for every patron. Minnie’s Helping Hands can gain an advantage by having a specific target audience and providing specialized needs. Also, these connections are more personal because of the high volunteer to patron ratio in the organization. Rosalyn is very motivated to help connect with new patrons. By creating a user-friendly and accessible UI interface and emphasizing Rosalyn’s motivation and heart for her organization, the organization has potential to grow its volunteer and patron base.

            Rosalyn, the founder, highlighted that she wanted to cater towards less fortunate families or previously incarcerated individuals who were in need and struggling to find accessible programs that provided resources, support, and opportunities. These groups of people most likely would fall between the ages of 20-40 years old.  Especially in regards to her clothing and toy drives, they are curated to people who would not be able to afford these items on their own. In addition, after incarceration, several individuals had challenges of reintegrating into society, so we wanted to showcase that this organization aimed to help them find programs to reintegrate into society after incarceration. 
        </div> 
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
            Therefore, our website solution aimed to become a resource for these families and individuals to easily access these services. Minnie’s Helping Hands’ website would be a platform for not only her own services offered but also a place for people to reach out to for additional resources. Additionally, she emphasized that as they are a small but growing organization, she wanted to also find funding and exposure in order to get started in future partnerships with community food banks/drives and housing assistance. Therefore, another audience that we had to curate the website to were sponsors to support their goals. By adding a section for donations and contact information on the website, she would easily be able to garner funding and financial donations from a wider range of people who were interested in supporting non-profit organizations.

    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 text start" >
             Not only did we hope to grow her organization through this aspect, but we also wanted to create more of an informational platform for her target audience to truly understand how Minnie’s Helping Hands could support them. By adding the mission statement, a summary of the organization, and background information on Rosalyn and her family it would create an online user-friendly space for people to easily understand the resources, services, and events she offers.

             By creating this website, we hoped to solve these problems of limited resources, lack of awareness and outreach, and identifying a reputable funding source by implementing specific features in our website through our project’s scope. Several aspects such as creating an informational page, projects/service highlights, and contact/donation channels helped us to reach the goal of creating an intuitive and accessible platform for underprivileged individuals. Our main motive was to truly showcase Minnie’s Helping Hands impact and support they offered for several communities through their mission statement, values, and overall goals and create funding initiatives to increase their resources. We successfully implemented our goals by integrating the following in the project scope:

                An Informational Section: <br>
                With an informational section of not only the organization itself, but also a background of Rosalyn and her family, we highlighted what made Minnie’s Helping Hands so unique from different non-profit organizations. We firstly created a stand alone informational section of Minnie’s Helping Hands that included their mission statement and main goals that they accomplished or plan to accomplish. Next, we included Rosalyn’s background experience in nursing to emphasize why she wanted to start this organization initially; this would give users more insight on Minnie’s Helping Hand’s values, and communities could easily see what Rosalyn and her family do. Furthermore, this section widely appealed to sponsors and more established organizations as they would gain knowledge on what exact resources Minnie’s Helping Hands may need, ultimately expanding on the resources they currently have.

                Project, Event, and Service Highlights: <br>
                We also included a section that highlighted past projects/events and current services that Minnie’s Helping Hands have. This provided more information on how several different communities engaged with this organization. As Minnie’s Helping Hands is still growing, we also included future plans that would be completed throughout the year, so users would engage with the organization more frequently. Additionally, to attract donations and partnerships, this section was very important as sponsors could see exactly what events and services their donations were contributing to, and other organizations could also collaborate with Minnie’s Helping Hands to create partnered events and projects, increasing community awareness and outreach.

                This section was a crucial portion of the website as one of our main goals was to get funding in order to grow the resources of Minnie’s Helping Hands. With less text heavy content in this section, we included a light summary of how to donate and how the contributions would support Rosalyn’s initiatives. In addition, there was a contact section of Rosalyn’s email address for collaboration and funding opportunities. Therefore, anyone with questions could connect with Minnie’s Helping Hands, and there would be increased possibilities of finding strong, reputable funding sources.

                User-friendly Interface: <br>
                Lastly, in order to cater to Minnie’s Helping Hand’s audience, our goal of this project was to create an efficient and intuitive interface that would immediately attract users. We aimed to make a website that was very easy to interact with and navigate through. Especially with the number of events and services that we wanted to promote, information hierarchy and organization was very important. By incorporating design elements such as alignment and grouping, we created a seamless responsive experience that could be viewed on various devices.

                Round 1: <br>
                For our first round of user testing, we decided to add more details and correct some alignment issues. Especially with our donation section, we added more information that let users enter personal information such as their name or contact in order for Minnie’s Helping Hands to connect with them for collaboration or donation opportunities. Most of our comments from round 1 were about alignment and the lack of detail on our donation page, so we were able to tackle these issues. Another comment someone had made was the confusion on the events/services page, so when we created our page through HTML and Javascript, we hoped to create hover/click features that expand details for each event and service offered. Overall, our wireframes had alignment issues and a lack of detail, so we were able to focus on these for the second iteration of the wireframe.

                Round 2: <br>
                Our website needed a lot more content overall. Part of that is an issue with the way information is displayed on the wireframe and partly because we are waiting on information from our client. The website also seemed to be unclear on what the organization specifically needed such as funds, items or partners.

                From round 1, we changed our wireframes to add more images and to restructure the website information so that the button to donate could be accessed throughout the website, and we added separate sections for the services that MHH offers and for the help that MHH would like to receive. <br>
                For round 2, we added more interactions, so the user could navigate through the different pages in one flow. We , furthermore, updated the website to reflect the organization’s purpose and to target specific audiences by whether they need help or they would like to help donate, support, or volunteer.             </div>

            Through multiple rounds of iterations and user testing, we were able to complete the website thoroughly with clear motives. Furthermore, we were able to pitch this website to professionals at The School of Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. With an organized and detailed live demo, we furthermore gained feedback from professionals that we could apply in the future.

                This project significantly enhanced our team's collaborative skills, enabling us to deliver a fully functional product for our client. Leveraging front-end tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript, we successfully contributed to the development of Minnie’s Helping Hands. Working alongside a highly motivated individual with commendable goals within the non-profit sector, I acquired valuable insights into front-end development, actively participating in both coding and design aspects. <br>
                This experience provided me with  real-world exposure to the  beginning-to-end process of creating a website. Taking charge of communication within the team and facilitating effective interaction with the client, I gained a comprehensive understanding of website development dynamics and how to work with clients as a team. The collaboration with a non-profit organization was particularly captivating, offering me profound insights into organizational operations and the nuanced management of a UX design team, thereby providing a tangible application of my design skills in a practical context.
