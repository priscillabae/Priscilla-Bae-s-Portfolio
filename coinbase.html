            Basing our design on an existing platform, we chose one of the biggest crypto wallet applications CoinBase. However, unlike facebook or Instagram, CoinBase doesn't have their icon shown in their interface.

            Because of this, we decided to have our scenario revolve around a new Coinbase user trying to send money in their cryptocurrency account.

                Lastly, we determined crypto's biggest pain points such as the lack of transparency and its steep learning curve. With these primary issues, we chose to identify one focus area of transparency with additional fees because according to our research, new users tend to misunderstand the meaning of some terms and lose more money than they originally intended to invest.

We started by simultaneously trying to first section out ideas and eventually discovered that "Transparency" and "Current UX/UI of Crypto" were two of the largest topics of our research. We determined that it combats the steep learning curve for new users that do not completely trust these platforms.

She wants to confirm a transaction for $3000, but accidentally types an extra zero and confirms a $30,000 transaction instead. Hayleigh is terrified because she's heard about how transactions using cryptocurrency are non-refundable by design, and is afraid she's lost thousands of dollars. Just when she thinks all hope is lost, she sees an "Undo Transaction" button on her screen, and remembers her crypto wallet delays transactions slightly to allow for undoing payments immediately after confirming. Hayleigh rushes to click the button and is relieved to see her payment was canceled, allowing her to confirm a correct transaction and saving her tens of thousands of dollars.

            Aaron wanted to start investing money to afford better housing that is closer to his workplace, and one of his friends suggested he look into the new trading product, crypto. After doing a lot of research and getting familiar with the concept of crypto, he decided to spend $400 on bitcoin. However, when he was ready to make the payment, he was shocked and confused by the total amount. It was over $600 and way out of his budget. Aaron felt very angry and confused because it seems like the platform is charging over 50% of his investment. However, he found a question mark next to the total. As he clicked on it, he saw a more detailed breakdown of his purchase with various fees identified and even some algorithms explained. After reading through that and understanding where he's spending his money, he felt more comfortable making the purchase.

            These stories contain more information regarding the user's emotion after using our interaction, and how this change in software possibly improved their experience. Having a thorough understanding of this helped us later in the process of prototyping to target their pain points. In addition, understanding how to paint a "rich picture" from the article, "What is User Scenarios" extremely helped our group create a story through knowing different audiences and their needs.

             Our processes for creating our wireframes were extremely similar. Overall, we were all thinking to have extra confirmation buttons and a page detailing the additional fees. We hoped that this would appeal to new users because they often do not fully understand the transaction decisions they are making. With these wireframes, we were able to collaborate and create a low-fi prototype.

                As we all decided on one wireframe we would like to pursue, including a checkout page, a confirmation page, a page with all the details, and a congratulations page, we each mapped it out with different composition and layouts. Some of us used blocks and alignment to categorize information, whereas others uses font size and font weight to achieve that. We had similar ideas we were able to combine which were a confirm button with an additional learn more feature and an explanation page for each separate fee. By collaborating with one another, we were able to use different aspects of our individual designs to create our low-fi prototype.

                    In our Final Lo-Fi Prototype, we decided to use horizontal lines and rounded squares as the element that separates different groups of information, so that it's easier for the user to digest all the information. In addition to this, we decided to enlarge the final checkout price to make it clear to the user and avoid impulsive purchase without understanding all the fees applied.

                    These miner and service fees make up a large amount of the sum, costing much more than users originally intended to spend. We thought that for this reason, we needed to place the fees in the very beginning, so users could inherently be curious about where almost double the amount of their spendings were going. This also inspired us to create the third page, so new users could better understand the crypto jargon.

                In order to learn about the fees, we had a "learn more" button. However, In order to clarify that this button referred to specifically the fees, our group decided to change the wording to "about fees". This was a small but significant change that really helped guide users in the testing. In addition, in this prototype, we started to adjust our designs to Coinbase's designs by using rounder buttons.

                After realizing having two transaction overview screens was redundant, we changed the first screen to display the amount to send without additional information. This also allowed us to better reflect Coinbase's interface, as the first screen was copied from Coinbase.

                We also realized the images we included on our information screen would be too small to interpret, so we allowed users to enlarge images by clicking them.

                We chose to use font size and font weight to highlight the total amount the user has to pay for the transaction and to makes to the numbers in different units more digestible. We also introduced an option for the user to learn more about the fees they are being charged.

    <div class="row">
        <div id = "descr2" class="col h6 mb-4 " >
                In the third and forth frame, the different color background distinguishes the informative page from the transactional one. We also gave user the opportunity to read the graph themselves and confirm the amount being charged. When the graph pops up, we chose to blur the background so that the user can focus on the important information.

                This process was extremely beneficial to my understanding of analyzing a specific audience to center your design around them. I really enjoyed learning about user scenarios and creating storyboards in order take into account of the emotions of users as positive human interactions and emotions are crucial aspects of having retention in an application. I also found it interesting that we were incorporating skills, such as typography and color choice, and I loved replicating something that I could potentially implement as an application update in the real world.

                Personally, from my past experiences with using Coinbase or any cryptocurrency application, I would quickly give up because the hardest aspect was understanding the jargon and graphs, similarly our interviewees had the same perceptions. We had several ideas such as providing tutorials or deciphering graphs/numbers. However, we wanted to focus on the importance of ethics because cryptocurrency's steep learning curve causes these platforms to take advantage over new users. Therefore we added the breakdowns of the fees along with a decipher of a graph.

                Overall, I was able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Be as ethical as possible in future designs</li>
                    <li>Create simple and unique to appeal to inexperience and experienced users</li>
                    <li>Conduct usability tests/interviews to constantly get user feedback</li>
