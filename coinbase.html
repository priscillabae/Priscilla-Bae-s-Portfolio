                    Our digital world overwhelms users with a large amount of information every second, which creates several complex systems that are challenging for new users to fully understand. Specifically, we focus on digital crypto trading systems. Cryptocurrency wallets in particular don’t clarify crypto concepts for their users, creating further confusion for beginner users.

                    Our main goal is to understand some of the pain points users may have and how can we improve their experience by improving crypto wallet design. To achieve this, we first identified some unethical designs and stakeholders. Next, we conducted interviews with stakeholders to gain more insights regarding their experience. From there, we synthesized our data collection and started to generate possible design solutions that can improve people’s experience. Through brainstorming and storyboarding, we were able to narrow down our problem space to confusion about various fees applied to each transaction. We then created wireframes and low-fi prototypes, adjusting our designs according to helpful feedback, and finally creating a higher fidelity prototype to showcase our design solution.</div>

                Why Did We Choose Coinbase? <br>
We chose to evaluate Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform, and we primarily focused on user transparency in additional fees. Coinbase is one of the most popular platforms for cryptocurrency, so if we were to implement this add-on, it would change the decisions and knowledge of millions of users. We chose Coinbase specifically because…

                Basing our design on an existing platform, we chose one of the biggest crypto wallet applications CoinBase. However, unlike facebook or Instagram, CoinBase doesn't have their icon shown in their interface. Before starting our Hi-Fi prototype, we first created a branding board that contains the color, font, and button CoinBase use for us to reference while prototyping.

                    <li>Cryptocurrency by default is hard to understand and unforgiving, so our design should specifically work to improve transparency</li>

                Because of this, we decided to have our scenario revolve around a new Coinbase user trying to send money in their cryptocurrency account. Since Coinbase has hidden fees that newer users would not understand, our scenario includes a new user trying to learn what fees were applied and why.

                Lastly, we determined crypto's biggest pain points such as the lack of transparency and its steep learning curve. With these primary issues, we chose to identify one focus area of transparency with additional fees because according to our research, new users tend to misunderstand the meaning of some terms and lose more money than they originally intended to invest.

                When making the synthesis as a group, we found several similarities in the individual research we had done. We started by simultaneously trying to first section out ideas and eventually discovered that “Transparency” and “Current UX/UI of Crypto” were two of the largest topics of our research. We determined that it combats the steep learning curve for new users that do not completely trust these platforms.

                I decided to focus on a novice crypto user who just started becoming more involved in crypto transactions, since this early cryptocurrency experimenting phase seems to be important in establishing trust in crypto applications.

In addition, it is extremely common for sudden and drastic changes in the market to occur, so I wanted to simulate a real-world situation. As transparency is extremely crucial in modern day design, I thought it would be important for people to see how hidden fees can be a huge burden and how not only inexperienced users but experienced users can avoid them.            </div>

                In this scenario, I zoomed in on people’s struggle with the extra fees being charged by the platform, especially for beginner users. In a real world context, this is one of the largest problem people suffer from using crypto wallets regardless they are experienced or not. In the brainstorming activity, I wanted to portray the how this problem has became a burden for the user and how the lack of transparency has made the user experience worse.         </div>

                Hayleigh began making transactions with cryptocurrency a few weeks ago, and decides to make her first large purchase with crypto. She wants to confirm a transaction for $3000, but accidentally types an extra zero and confirms a $30,000 transaction instead. Hayleigh is terrified because she’s heard about how transactions using cryptocurrency are non-refundable by design, and is afraid she’s lost thousands of dollars. Just when she thinks all hope is lost, she sees an “Undo Transaction” button on her screen, and remembers her crypto wallet delays transactions slightly to allow for undoing payments immediately after confirming. Hayleigh rushes to click the button and is relieved to see her payment was canceled, allowing her to confirm a correct transaction and saving her tens of thousands of dollars.

                Aaron wanted to start investing money to afford better housing that is closer to his workplace, and one of his friends suggested he look into the new trading product, crypto. After doing a lot of research and getting familiar with the concept of crypto, he decided to spend $400 on bitcoin. However, when he was ready to make the payment, he was shocked and confused by the total amount. It was over $600 and way out of his budget. Aaron felt very angry and confused because it seems like the platform is charging over 50% of his investment. However, he found a question mark next to the total. As he clicked on it, he saw a more detailed breakdown of his purchase with various fees identified and even some algorithms explained. After reading through that and understanding where he’s spending his money, he felt more comfortable making the purchase.

                In the first storyboards we did, some of us focused on the platform’s gain in the end instead of the user’s need. After presenting during the in class critique, we started to realize and understand why it is important to incorporate the user’s emotion throughout the entire storyboard and how it can be beneficial when it comes to learning whether our interaction design is user centered.

                These stories contain more information regarding the user’s emotion after using our interaction, and how this change in software possibly improved their experience. Having a thorough understanding of this helped us later in the process of prototyping to target their pain points. In addition, understanding how to paint a “rich picture” from the article, “What is User Scenarios” extremely helped our group create a story through knowing different audiences and their needs.            </div>

                Our processes for creating our wireframes were extremely similar. Overall, we were all thinking to have extra confirmation buttons and a page detailing the additional fees. We hoped that this would appeal to new users because they often do not fully understand the transaction decisions they are making. With these wireframes, we were able to collaborate and create a low-fi prototype.             </div>

                    As we all decided on one wireframe we would like to pursue, including a checkout page, a confirmation page, a page with all the details, and a congratulations page, we each mapped it out with different composition and layouts. Some of us used blocks and alignment to categorize information, whereas others uses font size and font weight to achieve that. We had similar ideas we were able to combine which were a confirm button with an additional learn more feature and an explanation page for each separate fee. By collaborating with one another, we were able to use different aspects of our individual designs to create our low-fi prototype.

                    In our Final Lo-Fi Prototype, we decided to use horizontal lines and rounded squares as the element that separates different groups of information, so that it’s easier for the user to digest all the information. In addition to this, we decided to enlarge the final checkout price to make it clear to the user and avoid impulsive purchase without understanding all the fees applied.

                    These miner and service fees make up a large amount of the sum, costing much more than users originally intended to spend. We thought that for this reason, we needed to place the fees in the very beginning, so users could inherently be curious about where almost double the amount of their spendings were going. This also inspired us to create the third page, so new users could better understand the crypto jargon.

                In order to learn about the fees, we had a “learn more” button. However, In order to clarify that this button referred to specifically the fees, our group decided to change the wording to “about fees”. This was a small but significant change that really helped guide users in the testing. In addition, in this prototype, we started to adjust our designs to Coinbase’s designs by using rounder buttons.

                In the third and forth frame, the different color background distinguishes the informative page from the transactional one.

                This process was extremely beneficial to my understanding of analyzing a specific audience to center your design around them. I really enjoyed learning about user scenarios and creating storyboards in order take into account of the emotions of users as positive human interactions and emotions are crucial aspects of having retention in an application. I also found it interesting that we were incorporating skills, such as typography and color choice, and I loved replicating something that I could potentially implement as an application update in the real world.

                Personally, from my past experiences with using Coinbase or any cryptocurrency application, I would quickly give up because the hardest aspect was understanding the jargon and graphs, similarly our interviewees had the same perceptions. We had several ideas such as providing tutorials or deciphering graphs/numbers. However, we wanted to focus on the importance of ethics because cryptocurrency’s steep learning curve causes these platforms to take advantage over new users. Therefore we added the breakdowns of the fees along with a decipher of a graph.

                Overall, I was able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Be as ethical as possible in future designs</li>
                    <li>Create simple and unique to appeal to inexperience and experienced users</li>
                    <li>Conduct usability tests/interviews to constantly get user feedback</li>
